This repository demonstrates a registration form in React without any additional libraries, with data validation and access token functionality. 
If you want to access the backend server, you need to clone this repository: https://github.com/marvelken/Node and run the server.
Later, I will add new repositories with more advanced functionalities. In this repository, I didn't focus much on the file structure, but on the functionalities and the registration system.
